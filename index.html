            Oh <strong>Allah</strong>, have mercy on my <strong>mother</strong> like she had mercy on me when I was younger. Oh Allah, make my mother <strong>happy</strong> like she made me. Oh Allah, accept my mother's actions <strong>both small and big</strong>. Oh Allah, let my mother be amongst those who are <strong>not afraid</strong> and those who are <strong>not sad</strong> and accept us in the highest place in <strong>Jannah</strong>.
